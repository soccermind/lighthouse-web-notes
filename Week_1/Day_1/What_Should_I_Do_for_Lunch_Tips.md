### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on you code iteratively - that means in small pieces. 

To help you figur out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting thier values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}
```
